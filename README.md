  <b>Power'em</b> is a website that allows the user to draw <b>any</b> RLC circuit and solve it. Say bye to CircuitLab, bye to Multisim and embrace Power'em. The project serves as a partial fulfillment of the Requirements of the Circuits' course that's taught to Computer Engineering freshmen (2019-2020) at Cairo Uiversity.

   <p>     
ðŸŸ¡ Draw the circuit on the website (index.html) then, download the netlist file. <br>
ðŸ”µ After downloading the file, runs the exe to solve the netlist -they should be in the same directory. <br>
ðŸ”´ Note that while drawing the circuit you need to select the two nodes first, then the element.
